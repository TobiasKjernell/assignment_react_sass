Sass can be very scale-able if you spend some time with it, learning the
tricks & hidden usecases. 

Small app made like this, i don't know if it's necessary to install sass. 
Still feels like normal css.modules can get you far with file structure and
to decouple classes. 

Not a fan of Tailwind at all but it's fast and it seems like alot of people
using it. Sass might be old but some companies still seems to use it. 

Looking forward to MUI because most of the companies i've been looking into using it.
